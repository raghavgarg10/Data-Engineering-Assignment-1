-- Verifying total number of records in each table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_items;

-- SECTION A — SQL Basics (SELECT, Constraints, Primary Keys)

-- Q1. Write a query to display all columns and rows from the customer's table. 

SELECT * FROM customers;

-- Q2. Retrieve only the first_name, last_name, and city of all customers.

SELECT first_name, last_name, city FROM customers;

-- Q3. List all unique categories available in the products table. 

SELECT DISTINCT category
FROM products;

/* 
Q4. Identify the Primary Key of each table in the schema. 
	Explain why a Primary Key must be unique and NOT NULL.
    
Answer:
customers   -> customer_id
products    -> product_id
orders      -> order_id
order_items -> item_id

Why UNIQUE?
1. Ensures every record is uniquely identifiable.
2. Eliminates duplicate entries in a table.
3. Helps maintain accuracy and consistency of data.

Why NOT NULL?
1. A record must always have a valid identifier.
2. NULL does not represent a unique value.
3. Required for linking tables through foreign keys.

*/

/*
Q5. What constraints are applied to the email column in the customers table? 
What would happen if you tried to insert a duplicate email? 

Answer:

Constraints:
1. UNIQUE → Duplicate email addresses are not allowed. 
2. NOT NULL → Email cannot be empty.

If a duplicate email is inserted,
the database throws a duplicate entry error and rejects the record.

*/

/*
Q6. Try inserting a product with unit_price = -50. What happens and which constraint prevents it? 
Write both the INSERT statement and explain the error. 

INSERT INTO products
VALUES (209,'Test Product','Electronics',
'TestBrand',-50,100);

Result:
The insertion fails because of the CHECK constraint:

Reason:

CHECK (unit_price > 0)

The CHECK constraint prevents negative values
from being inserted into unit_price.

*/

-- Section B — Filtering & Optimization (WHERE, Indexes) 

-- Q7. Retrieve all orders with status = 'Delivered'. 

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'Delivered';

-- Q8. Find all products in the 'Electronics' category with a unit_price greater than ₹2000. 

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Electronics' AND unit_price > 2000;

-- Q9. List all customers who joined in the year 2024 and belong to the state 'Maharashtra'. 

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE state = 'Maharashtra' AND join_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';

-- Q10. Find all orders placed between '2024-08-10' and '2024-08-25' (inclusive) that are NOT cancelled. 

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-08-10' AND '2024-08-25' AND status <> 'Cancelled';

/*
Q11. Explain what the index idx_orders_date does. How would it improve the performance of a query that filters orders by order_date? 
Write a sample query that would benefit from this index. 

Answer - 

The idx_orders_date index is created on the order_date column.
It helps the database find orders faster when filtering or sorting by date, because it avoids scanning the entire table.

Purpose:
1. Speeds up filtering operations.
2. Speeds up sorting operations.
3. Reduces full table scans.
4. Improves query performance on large datasets.

Sample Query:
*/

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date = '2024-08-15';

/*
Q12. If you run: 
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE YEAR(join_date) = 2024; would the index on join_date be used?
Explain why or why not and rewrite the query to be index-friendly (SARGable).

Answer:
The index may not be used efficiently because the YEAR() function is applied to the column.

This forces MySQL to evaluate every row, which can reduce index effectiveness.

Non-SARGable Query:
*/

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE YEAR(join_date) = 2024;

-- Section C — Aggregation (GROUP BY, SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX) 

-- Q13. Count the total number of orders in the orders table.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_orders FROM orders;

-- Q14. Find the total revenue (SUM of total_amount) from all Delivered orders.

SELECT SUM(total_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'Delivered';

-- Q15. Calculate the average unit_price of products in each category. 

SELECT category,
       AVG(unit_price) AS avg_unit_price
FROM products
GROUP BY category;

-- Q16. For each order status, find the count of orders and the total revenue. Sort the result by total revenue in descending order. 

SELECT status,
       COUNT(*) AS order_count,
       SUM(total_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM orders
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- Q17. Find the most expensive (MAX) and cheapest (MIN) product in each category. 

SELECT category,
       MAX(unit_price) AS most_expensive,
       MIN(unit_price) AS cheapest
FROM products
GROUP BY category;

-- Q18. List all product categories where the average unit_price is greater than ₹2000. (Hint: Use HAVING clause) 

SELECT category,
       AVG(unit_price) AS avg_unit_price
FROM products
GROUP BY category
HAVING AVG(unit_price) > 2000;

-- Section D — Joins & Relationships 

/* 
Q19. Write an INNER JOIN query to display each order along with the customer's first_name and last_name. 
Show: order_id, order_date, first_name, last_name, total_amount. 
*/

SELECT o.order_id,
       o.order_date,
       c.first_name,
       c.last_name,
       o.total_amount
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN customers c
    ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
    
/*
 Q20. Using a LEFT JOIN, list ALL customers and their orders (if any). 
 Customers with no orders should still appear with NULL values for order columns. 
 */
 
 SELECT c.customer_id,
       c.first_name,
       c.last_name,
       o.order_id,
       o.order_date,
       o.total_amount
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
    ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
    
/*
Q21. Write a query using JOINs across three tables 
orders → order_items → products
show : order_id, product_name, quantity, unit_price, and discount_pct for each order item. 
*/

SELECT o.order_id,
       p.product_name,
       oi.quantity,
       oi.unit_price,
       oi.discount_pct
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi
    ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p
    ON oi.product_id = p.product_id;

/*
Q22. Explain the difference between LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN with an example from this schema. 
When would you use a FULL OUTER JOIN? 

Answer:
LEFT JOIN : Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.

Example:
customers LEFT JOIN orders
All customers will appear even if they have not placed any order.

RIGHT JOIN : Returns all records from the right table and matching records from the left table.

Example:
customers RIGHT JOIN orders
All orders will appear even if customer information is missing.

FULL OUTER JOIN:
Returns all matching and non-matching records from both tables.
Used when we want complete data from both tables regardless of matches.
*/

/*
Q23. Identify all Foreign Key relationships in the schema. 
Explain what would happen if you tried to insert an order with customer_id = 999 (which doesn't exist in customers).

Answer -

Foreign Keys in the Schema
1. orders.customer_id → references customers.customer_id
2. order_items.order_id → references orders.order_id
3. order_items.product_id → references products.product_id

If customer_id = 999 is inserted into the orders table, the database will reject the insertion because 
no customer with ID 999 exists in the customers table. 
The Foreign Key constraint will be violated, resulting in an error.

Example - 

*/
INSERT INTO orders VALUES
( 1011, 999, '2024-08-30', 'Pending', 1000);

-- Section E — Advanced Concepts (CASE, ACID, Transactions) 

/*
Q24. Write a query using CASE to classify products into price tiers:

Mid-Range → unit_price BETWEEN 1000 AND 3000
Premium   → unit_price > 3000

/*
Q25. Using a CASE statement inside an aggregate function, count:
1. Delivered Orders
2. Not Delivered Orders
Display result in a single row.
*/

SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'Delivered' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS delivered_orders,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status <> 'Delivered' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS not_delivered_orders
FROM orders;

/*
Q26. Explain each letter of ACID: 
  • A – Atomicity 
  • C – Consistency 
  • I – Isolation 
  • D – Durability 
Give a real-world example (e.g., bank transfer) showing why each property is important. 

Answer -

A - Atomicity
A transaction is either completed fully or not executed at all.
Example: In a bank transfer, if money is deducted from one account but not added to another, the transaction is rolled back.

C - Consistency
Ensures that data remains valid before and after the transaction.
Example:
Total money in the banking system should remain unchanged after transfer.

I - Isolation
Multiple transactions should not interfere with each other.
Example:
Two users transferring money simultaneously should not affect each other's transactions.

D - Durability
Once a transaction is committed, it remains permanently stored.
Example:
Even if the database crashes after a successful transfer, the data remains saved.
